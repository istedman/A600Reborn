# A600Reborn

Amiga A600 schematics recaptured in KiCad and a new PCB design created from them. 
There is currently one, working, version which replaces the RF modulator with a mini-DIN for S-video.

Schematics and baseline PCB captured by Mick @ EAB. Checked and updated by myself.

The Baseline version is still undergoing testing and is currently not fully functioning, this vairant is not published here.
Use the A600_S_Video branch if you want to try the working variant.

The S-Video variant, which was tracked via manual methods, rather than auto-routed, currently works and boots.
